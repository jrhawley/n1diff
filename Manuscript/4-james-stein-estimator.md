# James-Stein Estimator

Consider the following scenario. For a $p$-variate normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and known covariance matrix $\Sigma$, if we observe a single realization of this distribution, $Z \in \mathbb{R}^p$, what is a good estimator, $\hat{\mu}$, for the unknown mean $\mu$?
