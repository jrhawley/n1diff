# Data

* Using total RNA-seq of 6 T2E+ and 6 T2E- primary prostate cancer samples
  * See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1505/1505.00588.pdf) for appropriate number of biological replicates
  * Might actually be worth using that data, itself, instead of the prostate cancer stuff
* Differential gene expression analysis is performed with Kallisto + Sleuth
