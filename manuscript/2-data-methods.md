# Data

* Using total RNA-seq of 6 T2E+ and 6 T2E- primary prostate cancer samples
  * See [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/22/3625/240923) for appropriate number of biological replicates
  * Might actually be worth using that data, itself, instead of the prostate cancer stuff
* Differential gene expression analysis is performed with Kallisto + Sleuth
